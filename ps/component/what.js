					In <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>, in his own special way, Ludwig Wittgenstein developed a critique of the understanding of justification -and by extension of rationality itself- which prevails in Western philosophy. At the core of this understanding is the thought that an individual determines for her or himself whether a belief is justified by systematically interrogating its empirical credentials or logical relations to other justified beliefs. Wittgenstein\'s criticism, in a nutshell, was that an individual in isolation -so, a Robinson Crusoe, or a speaker of a private language- would lack the wherewithal to differentiate what s/he ought to believe or say from what s/he is inclined to believe or say. S/he would lack the means to make the distinction between what seems right and what is right. To the extent that being able to make sense of meaning something in uttering an expression requires being able to make this distinction, the criticism impugns the very intelligibility of our talk\'s being meaningful, and -insofar as our thoughts are formulated in language- our beliefs\' being justified.</p>
				<p>
					Many philosophers, while possibly intrigued by the critique, I think take it to be just another more or less persuasive sceptical argument, on a par with external world scepticism or the Sorites paradox: something worthy of attention, but nothing whose conclusion can seriously be taken to heart. This attitude is abetted by the impression, which I consider valid, that what Wittgenstein offered by way of a solution was at best inchoate.

					This apparently prevalent attitude to Wittgenstein\'s scepticism I consider to be a mistake. The present theory represents a fully-formed, coherent conception of semantics consistent with the critique. 
					It takes as its starting point Wittgenstein\'s insistence on the obvious fact that explanations come to an end, at which point there is just what one is inclined to do or say. The theory shows that the concepts of semantics can be fully reconstructed from this basis, complete with a robust and stable distinction between what is right and what merely seems to be, if only one rejects certain commonplace assumptions.
