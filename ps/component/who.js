		           I am a computer programmer, living in Toronto. I became a programmer mainly because my interest in life has always been to understand the nature of thinking, and I figured the best way to work out ideas would be to write programs to implement them - I wanted to work on what most people call artificial intelligence. I have a pile of thoughts on the subject, totally unrelated to what\'s here, and of probably about the same value.

		            Before taking up programming I studied philosophy. I was ambivalent about the value of the discipline and also not very good at it. Whether these two conditions are related as cause and effect, and if so how, I cannot say.
