  Much of Analytic philosophy is premised on a fundamental, unquestioned assumption. Expressed as a slogan, it is this:

  Things precede facts.

  That's pretty cryptic, I admit. What do I mean? 

  I know people like my brother-in-law or my my barber, places, like Thunder Bay or Madrid, or even in some sense abstract things like the greek alphabet say, the characteristic silhouette of the Jaguar E type. (what blue or saltiness or softness is)
  
  But we also - differently - know *that* ..., that 

  This is the contrast I'm after - knowledge of things, and knowledge of propositions which state facts. 

  My slogan encapsulates the - very natural - thought that our epistemic journey in life begins with the first kind of knowledge, of things, and proceeds from there to knowledge of propositions.

  This project explores the implications of renouncing this assumption.


  Our brains and minds are finite. Nevertheless, we are capable of expressing and understanding an effectively infinite variety of different thoughts. How can this be? The answer in philosophy is this: we are acquainted with a limited range of things and the qualities they can have, and know a corresponding limited range of words to name the things and their qualities. We are also equipped with a finite set of grammatical rules for combining these words into sentences. But put together, these things - our words and rules of grammar - conspire to give us an effective infinity of possible thoughts.
  
This answer is seductive in its simplicity. It is also mistaken. There is a much, much better way of understanding how language, meaning, and ultimately our minds' relation to the world, work. 

The purpose of this site is to explain, in clear, straight-forward terms, this better way. The outcome of the investigation is this:

* Propositions -the contents of thoughts - are just sets of sentences (token sentences) whose words match in their (token) meanings. That is *all* they are.

* Two words have the same meaning just in case they can be substituted in all relevant token sentences without altering the truth of the re-worded sentences. That is *all* there is to meaning. Spelling out that 'relevant' is the crux of the biscuit.
