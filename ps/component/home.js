		</p>
		<p>
It is widely thought that our reactions to the things people say is explained by our grasp of their words&#39; meanings and our knowledge of the grammar of our shared language.
		</p>
		<p>
The big idea is that this thought gets matters roughly upside-down. The confidence we have in what people say understood one way is explained by neuroscience without help from concepts like meaning; understood another way, it is a foundation on which to build our understanding of truth and meaning.  Once set upright, a lot of things - truth, meaning, even consciousness, become much clearer. The gap in our understanding of the mind is closed. But the world looks a lot different.
