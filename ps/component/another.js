Here is another pass at the ideas here. 

In usual treatments of semantics we take our valuations of sentences - how strongly we believe them- to be explained in part by semantics. If I value 'the dog is on the rug', I do so in part because of what I understand the sentence to mean. Characterising this is the province of semantics.

But semantics is not needed to explain valuations. The causal explanation of my receptivity to these words or inclination to utter them can presumably be fully provided by the theory of the functioning of neural networks, and this in a way which omits mention of meanings or propositions. I see the inclination to try to insert semantics into the scientific explanation of sentence valuations as being of a piece with the Chomskyan effort to construe judgements of grammaticality as a consequence of the following of rules of syntax. 

Renouncing the project of explaining such feelings in terms - in part - of the processing of semantic information opens the salutary possibility of treating valuings as primitives in the understanding of semantic concepts. 

This model is the elaboration of this possibility. <Wittgensteinian idea here> We can circle back once its morals have been drawn and look to compare the relation between its conception of valuings as primitive and the scientific conception of their behavioural counterparts as explicable in neuropsychological terms, and consider the implications of the relation. But for the purposes of the model it turns out to be fruitful to postpone any such questions.

Having done all this, it is not hard to conceive of the uttering and hearing of sentences, superficially considered, as having as its goal, the maximization of value, to a first approximation. The approximation has genuinely to be preliminary, as the model fairly quickly falls down if value is conceived as having intrinsic interest and being the only goal of linguistic interaction. If token sentences are intrinsically valuable, then why not endlessly repeat banalities? If not, though, then how do token sentences get lumped into types, absent the kind of semantic information we're trying to explicate? Better to posit a further, intrinsically valuable quantity which some but not all valuable sentences provoke (don't need to say which), and which, like (the Behaviourists') Pavlov's lever pushing, pellet-seeking pigeons, we maximize by maximizing our experience of valuable token sentences (to a first approximation).  

If, as we can posit to be the case, the experience of pleasure increases geometrically for a speaker in a community of like-minded speakers as compared with a solitary agent, then a community's language would plausibly come to have interesting properties absent from a solitary speaker's. In particular, a community of speakers each collaborating collectively to maximize her or his own linguistic pleasure, would naturally enter into a kind of a speech contract. The contract would bind speakers to utter only valuable sentences

It might, then, become useful to have a term for a sentence compliant with the contract and one not so - those terms could be 'true' and 'false'.
